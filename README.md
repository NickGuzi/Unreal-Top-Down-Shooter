# Unreal-Top-Down-Shooter
I had been obsessed with a top down shooter on my phone, therefore, when I was tasked with creating my own game during my internship at Prosper IT Consulting, I decided to create one of my own. Since I was given just a 10 day sprint to complete a fully functioning game on Unreal, I thought a top down shooter/survival game was a challenging yet feasible project to tackle. My main goal in recreating this game was to give users a fast paced, yet fun experience that they want to play over & over again. 

## Scene Management
Scene management within this project is controlled by several blueprint widgets that swap between the main menu, game, and end screen.
